# golcl
New crossplatform GUI for Golang.  Adaptation VCL github.com/ying32/govcl for crossplatform Freepascal LCL. Work with like Delphi/Lazarus visual components, methods and events on Go in Delphi style. The first adaptation of govcl (github.com/ying32/govcl) to Lazarus LCL.

I modify/adaptation Delphi-like code from govcl project for Lazarus/Freepascal and compile DLL library for the Win64 system in 64Bit Lazarus. In Lazarus not presents all methods, visual components and more more from Delphi.. but everything works ... and even more: new components will gradually be added, for example, a Stringgrid has already been added to work with tabular data (in the testing phase, just lack of free time).    

Demonstration:
- Screenshot 
- Or load  testexe.zip, extract and run  (in demonstration added StringGrid component in Tab1)

IIt`s best way make GUI on Golang for works tables data. In future i add Data-access components (Datasets, Zeos, Lazreport...) 

For compilation:
Install github.com/ying32/govcl and Play with main.go file (64bit Dll in complect):

All sources Lazarus/Freepascal project files added in future (not all components work stable)
