# golcl
New crossplatform GUI for Golang.  Adaptation VCL github.com/ying32/govcl for crossplatform Freepascal LCL. Work with like Delphi/Lazarus visual components, methods and events on Go in Delphi style. The first adaptation of govcl (github.com/ying32/govcl) to Lazarus LCL.

I modify/adaptation Delphi10-like code for Lazarus/Freepascal and compile DLL library for the Win64 system in 64Bit Lazarus. 

Demonstration:
- Screenshot 
- Or load  testexe.zip, extract and run  (in demonstration added StringGrid component in Tab1)

IIt`s best way make GUI on Golang for works tables data. In future i add Data-access components (Datasets, Zeos, Lazreport...) 

For compilation:
Install github.com/ying32/govcl and Play with main.go file (64bit Dll in complect):

All sources Lazarus/Freepascal project files added in future (not all components work stable)
