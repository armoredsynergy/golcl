Adaptation VCL github.com/ying32/govcl for Freepascal LCL

This is the first adaptation of govcl (github.com/ying32/govcl) to Lazarus LCL. I make DLL library for the Win64 system. 

Demonstration:
- Screenshot 
- Or load  testexe.zip, extract and run  (in demonstration added StringGrid component in Tab1)

It`s best way make gui on Golang for works tables data in golang. In future added works with Data-access components (Datasets, Zeos, Lazreport...) 

For compilation:
Install github.com/ying32/govcl and Play with main.go file (64bit Dll in complect):

All sources Lazarus/Freepascal project files added in future (not all components work stable)
