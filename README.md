Adaptation VCL github.com/ying32/govcl for Freepascal LCL

This is the first adaptation of govcl (github.com/ying32/govcl) to Lazarus LCL. I make DLL library for the Win32 system. Unfortunately, under 64Bit does not work (the problem with the function ShowMessage when RUN the DLL - this Lazarus 64Bit problem).

This TEST and VERY NOT STABLE LIBRARY for demonstration works LCL from Golang code. Library adaptation on 10%.

Demonstration:
Load .DLL and .EXE file for run  (works only button and messages)

For compilation:
Install github.com/ying32/govcl and Play with main.go file:
